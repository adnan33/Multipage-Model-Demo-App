Following model/project demos are added here. It will be updated after each project. Check out the [github](https://github.com/adnan33/Multipage-Model-Demo-App.git) repository to know more about the projects.

1. <b><a href="Cloth_Segmentation/" target="_self">Cloth Segmentation Model</a></b>
    - A ***binary semantic segmentation*** model to segment out cloth from single cloth image.
2. <b><a href="Cloth_Segmentation_On_Person/" target="_self">Cloth Segmentation On Human Body Model</a></b>
    - A ***multi-class (3 classes) semantic segmentation*** model to segment out upper and lower body cloths from an image of a person.
3. <b><a href="Human_Parsing/" target="_self">Human Parsing Model</a></b>
    -  A ***multi-class (20 classes) semantic segmentation*** model for the task of **[human parsing](https://paperswithcode.com/task/human-parsing)**.
